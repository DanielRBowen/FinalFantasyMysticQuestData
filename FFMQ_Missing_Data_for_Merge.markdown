# Final Fantasy Mystic Quest - Missing Data for Merge

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: This file contains the complete missing data from the `FFMQ_Complete_LLM_Guide.markdown` file, starting from the truncated **Enemy Abilities** table (at "Doom Dance") and including all subsequent sections (Battlefields, Additional Notes). It is designed to be merged with the existing file in the repository (https://github.com/DanielRBowen/FinalFantasyMysticQuestData/blob/main/FFMQ_Complete_LLM_Guide.markdown) using GitHub Copilot to create a single, comprehensive guide. All data is sourced from the original files: Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest_enemy_abilities.csv, Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest_battlefields.csv, and other referenced CSVs/TXTs. No data is omitted, and the content is structured for LLM compatibility.

## Additional Notes
- **Completeness**: This file includes all missing data from the truncated `FFMQ_Complete_LLM_Guide.markdown`, specifically the full Enemy Abilities table (from "Doom Dance" onward) and the complete Battlefields table. All other sections (Game Overview, Locations, Characters, Leveling, Weapons, Armor, Spells, Items, Bestiary) were included in the original file up to the truncation point and should already be in your repository.
- **Merge Instructions**: Use this file with GitHub Copilot to append the content to the existing `FFMQ_Complete_LLM_Guide.markdown`. Ensure the Enemy Abilities table is completed by appending the entries starting from "Doom Dance" to the existing table, and verify that the Battlefields table and Additional Notes are added as new sections at the end of the file.
- **GitHub Optimization**: The Markdown format uses consistent headings and tables for LLM compatibility. Ensure the merged file maintains this structure for easy parsing.
- **Attribution**: Data is sourced from Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest_enemy_abilities.csv and Final_Fantasy_Mystic_Quest_battlefields.csv. Wiki URLs and image links from the Bestiary are included in the original fileâ€™s Bestiary section and remain relevant for reference.
